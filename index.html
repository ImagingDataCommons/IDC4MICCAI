        <h2>Date: Sunday, Oct 8, 2023</h2>
        <h2>Time: 8am-12:30pm PDT</h2>
<br><br>
        <p><a href="https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/">NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC)</a> is a cloud-based repository of publicly available, real-world cancer imaging data co-located with the analysis and exploration tools and resources. IDC is a node within the broader <a href="https://datacommons.cancer.gov/">NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)</a> infrastructure that provides secure access to , comprehensive, diverse, and expanding multi-modality collections of cancer research data, including genomics, proteomics, and clinical trial data. CRDC’s cloud-based infrastructure offers a number of advantages to researchers, including ubiquitous access to data and tools, elastic storage and compute (particularly on large datasets), access to readily available cloud-native AI/ML tools, and enhanced orchestration and automation of workflows.  As of January 2023, IDC hosts over 40 TB of public radiology and digital pathology images and image-derived data, all in standard DICOM representation, co-located with the tools to support search, visualization, and analysis of the data. </p>

<p>IDC public data is available for cloud-based analysis or download in the public Google Storage buckets. IDC team is also working on providing the data in Amazon Web Services (AWS) buckets, which should be completed and released in time for MICCAI 2023. This tutorial will utilize a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises to introduce the attendees to the IDC and the main principles behind its development, and learn the basic skills of how to use IDC to search, visualize and download image data, and develop IDC-related AI workflows.</p>
<br><br>

        <h2>Agenda</h2>

<p>We are in the process of finalizing the agenda of the tutorial. Our plan is to split the time between the lectures and hands-on sessions. The lectures will introduce IDC and some of the main concepts behind it, and will demonstrate some of the use cases and applications that utilize IDC data. </p>
